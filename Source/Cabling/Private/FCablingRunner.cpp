	* 
	* Per the docs:
	Rather than using GetNextReading to walk through potentially dozens of historical mouse readings and 
	adding up the deltas, they're accumulated into a virtual positionX and positionY value. From there,
	deltas are calculated by subtracting the positionX and positionY value from the previous readings that 
	were obtained. Individual deltas are accessible when iterating through all intermediate readings, or
	through the accumulated deltas when intermediate readings have been skipped.
	
	The positionX and positionY values are the sum of all movement deltas.
	These values don't correlate with screen-space coordinates in any way. 
	The accumulated delta value is only for the mouse events that a process receives while it has input focus.
